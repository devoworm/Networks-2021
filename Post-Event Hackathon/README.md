## Post-event Hackathon  

DevoWorm-Networks tie-ins. 

1) Graph-NNs --> 

2) Neural-CAs --> 

3) Network/Developmental trees. Cell lineage, Interactions.

4) representation of nodes and edges -- nodes as cellular machines, edges as intercellular diffusion.

1 and 2 -- add to BNNs/ANNs paper.

#### Structure and Function of Development

* structure (morphogenetic, heterogeneity).

* divergent processes -- structure/function? Developmental symmetry-breaking.

* at what point does one subsystem become two? Can we build a hybrid developmental tree-proximity network to demonstrate this?

DevoWorm promotion:

* post DevoWorm update from 2020 (LinkedIn, OREL Twitter).

* blog post follow-up.
