In biological science, the application of networks has been quite successful at the level of genes, proteins, cell population, and even individual organisms. Yet in cases where the relationship between nodes, arcs, and temporal events are clearly identifiable, network analysis can be less effective. These hard-to-define phenomena require special considerations in terms of how they are represented. For the 10th anniversary of the Hard-to-Define Events (HTDE) workshop, we will walk through three examples. The first is systems with rare events, or out-of-distribution events that occur extremely rarely in a given spatiotemporal context. Systems with non-normally distributed processes will be discussed next, and includes revisiting the role of critical, cascading, and long-tail phenomena. Finally, we will consider cases in which nodes are poorly defined in terms of their compartmentalization and/or epistemology. Revisiting the notion of HTDE in biological systems, we will focus on future work synthesizing these observations into a set of theoretical principles.
